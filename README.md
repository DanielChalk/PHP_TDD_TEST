# Todo

We have a function and a template you need to implement, your function will be affected by the type of template you're trying to create. 

If you're successful in creating these, the unit tests will pass.

May i suggest you look at the tests first!

Enjoy.

# running unit tests

```bash
cd /to/the/project
vendor\bin\phpunit tests
```
